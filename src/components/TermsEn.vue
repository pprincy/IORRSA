            Seller or RSA (the “Non-Breaching Party”) may terminate this
            Agreement for a material breach by the other Party (the “Breaching
            Party”) as per the process set forth in this clause. The
            Non-Breaching Party will provide the Breaching Party with written
            notice of any material breach as soon as it occurs, describing in
            detail the nature of the material breach. Following receipt of such
            notice the Breaching Party will have an opportunity to remedy the
            material breach within thirty (30) days of receipt of the notice. If
            the material breach is not cured during the remedy period agreed
            above, or if its nature is such that it is incapable of being cured,
            then the Non-Breaching Party would be entitled to terminate this
            Agreement with immediate effect.

          importer including any data, information, files of completed or
          unfinished work to Seller, and shall have no lien over the property of

          Each party agrees to fulfil their respective rights and obligations
          with respect to any shipment that takes place on or before the

          Any dispute or difference between Seller and RSA in connection with
          the terms of this Agreement, if not resolved amicably, shall be
          referred to arbitration in accordance with the UNCITRAL Model Law on
          International Commercial Arbitration (1985) as amended from time to

          Seller and RSA so agree, and failing such agreement, the arbitral
          tribunal shall comprise three arbitrators, Seller and RSA appointing
          one arbitrator each and the third arbitrator shall be selected by the
          two arbitrators so appointed. The place of arbitration shall be Dubai,
          UAE and the language of arbitration shall be English. The award passed
          by the arbitral tribunal including any award on cost of such
          arbitration shall be final and binding on Seller and RSA.
        </p>
        <p>
          The reference to any matter, dispute or claim to arbitration and/or
          the continuance of any arbitration proceedings consequent thereto
          shall in no way operate as a waiver of the obligations of the Parties
          to perform their respective obligations under this Agreement.

        <p>
          <span>
            Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, RSA shall have the option
            of referring any dispute to the DIFC Courts in Dubai International
            Financial Centre, United Arab Emirates (the “<u>DIFC</u>”). If RSA
            is the defending party, such option must be declared within 14
            calendar days of a notice of claim pursuant to the foregoing
            arbitration provisions, and upon such declaration the parties shall
            procure that the arbitration is discontinued (without any award
            being given). If RSA exercises its option, Seller waives any
            objection now or later to any proceedings relating to the Agreement
            being brought in the DIFC and the parties hereby irrevocably submit
            to the exclusive jurisdiction of the DIFC.

          of any of its obligations under or arising out of the Agreement if
          such delay or failure results from any of the following force majeure
          events i.e., act of God, war, any government prohibition which renders
          it impossible for Seller or RSA to fulfil their obligations under this
          Agreement. Any delay beyond the reasonable timelines, may be a valid
          cause to terminate the Agreement and accordingly, the parties shall
          return respective goods, documents, and information upon such an event
          and shall act in the professional manner to ensure that the risk is
          mitigated to the best of efforts for other party. Notwithstanding the
          foregoing, RSA shall have all the right to terminate this Agreement by
          notice at any time during a force majeure event.
